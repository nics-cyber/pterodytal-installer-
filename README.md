# Pterodactyl Installer Script

This script automates the installation of the **Pterodactyl Panel** and **Wings** without requiring a domain or external IP address. It uses the server's local IP address for configuration, making it ideal for local or development environments.

---

## **Features**

- **No Domain Required:** The script uses the server's local IP address for the Panel and Wings configuration.
- **Fully Automated:** Installs all dependencies, configures the Panel, and sets up Wings in one go.
- **Secure Database:** Automatically generates a secure password for the MariaDB database.
- **Nginx Configuration:** Sets up Nginx to serve the Panel using the local IP address.
- **Wings Integration:** Configures Wings to connect to the Panel automatically.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- A clean **Ubuntu Server** (20.04 or 22.04 recommended).

## **Accessing the Panel**

Once the script completes, you can access the Pterodactyl Panel using the server's local IP address:

```
http://<server-ip>

```

## **Post-Installation Steps**

### **1. Secure the Panel**
For production use, it's recommended to secure the Panel with SSL. You can use Let's Encrypt to obtain a free SSL certificate.

### **2. Configure Firewall**
Ensure your server's firewall is configured to allow traffic on ports `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS).

### **3. Create an Admin User**
If you didn't create an admin user during installation, you can do so by running:

```bash
sudo php /var/www/pterodactyl/artisan p:user:make
```

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **1. Permission Errors**
If you encounter permission errors, ensure the script is run with `sudo`.

### **2. Nginx Issues**
If Nginx fails to start, check the configuration file for errors:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

### **3. Wings Not Connecting**
Ensure Wings is configured to connect to the correct Panel URL. You can reconfigure Wings by running:

```bash
sudo wings configure --panel-url http://<server-ip> --token <panel-api-token>
```
